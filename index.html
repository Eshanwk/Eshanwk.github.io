    <p>This is a very special recipe book I made all by myself. I do not wish for anyone to have a good time while baking, so I have formed three very thoughtful recipes. Three recipes are not a lot but no one should be making these anyway.The goal of completing these recipes is so that anyone who does make these dishes, never cook again after being saddend by the failures and wasted time from the created dishes. With nothing left to say, let us begin!

        <h2 id="chocobad">Chocolate Garbage</h2>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Chocolate_%28blue_background%29.jpg/200px-Chocolate_%28blue_background%29.jpg" id="coco">
        
       <p>This recipe was inspired by myself, I thought putting anything with garbage makes it bad, so why not chocolate?<p>
       
        <ul>
            <li>Time:0-30hrs
            <li>Serves:0(anyone willing to eat the dish)
        </ul>
        
     <h3> You will need:</h3>
        <ul><li>40kg of semi-sweet chocolate <li>10kg of frozen butter<li>6 pounds of garbage (or 1tonne)<li>10 carboard boxes<li>salt(not optional) <li>7 quarters(or 20)</ul>
        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Start by ordering a vacuum cleaner or a storage unit(optional)
        <br><strong>Step 2: </strong>Go to sleep with a pizza cutter<br>
        <strong>Step 3:</strong> Preheat an oven to 39678 degrees kelvin that is outside to bake
        <br><strong>Step:</strong> Go make some friends
        <br> <strong>step:20</strong> eat some food so you do not get hungry<br>
        <strong>Step 21:</Strong> Buy some butter and mix the butter with the 10kg of frozen butter. Make sure to add 5kg after just in case.
        Step <br> <strong>Steppy:</strong> Melt 20kg of 100% dark chocolate and then throw away 30kg of semi-sweet chocolate. <br> <strong>Step 1:</strong> Eat 25kg of semi-sweet chocolate
        <br> <strong>Step1:</strong> Try to send 6 pounds of garbage (or 1tonne; preferable) to a random adress, pay the UPS guy 7 quarters, if denied, dispose of garbage in the ocean and sit in 10 carboard boxes
        <br> <strong>Step final:</strong> Enjoy! (not optional)

        <h2 id="sandbad">Pumpkin Pie (Depressing Sandwich)</h2> <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/Pumpkin_Pie.jpg/250px-Pumpkin_Pie.jpg">
             <ul>
            <li>Time:3 seconds
            <li>Serves:5 chickens worth of body weight
        </ul>
        
        <p>Unlike most sandwiches, this one taste very bad! It is known as pumpkin pie but really, it is a sandwich that tastes bad. Unlike chocolate garbage, depressing sandwich requires very minimal ingredients to produce something.</p> <h3>You will need:</h3> <ul><li>10 preowned pumpkin pies<li>7 left foot shoes(preferably size 8)</ul>
    <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Try on the 7 left shoes, afterwords, throw them in the recycling bin<br><strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to the subway station and race the train, make sure to carry the pies just incase of an emergency <br><strong>Step 3: Go be sad on a park bench</strong> <br> <strong>Step 4:</strong> Find a reason and move on <br> <strong>Step 5:</strong> No longer nothing</p>
